# Comment-Section-Fetch-API-PHP
In this repository, I developed a php file using which I can comunicate with a database with Fetch API. You can download this small project and see how it works or visit https://rentapartment-kiev.com/CommentSection/. I use Fetch API with a method POST and send a SQL command that I want to be executed to PHP. PHP file receives the request and send the appropriate  response back to fetch API. This project is not done yet. There I have to validate a lot of things on the back-end.
